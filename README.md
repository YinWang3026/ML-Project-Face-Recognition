Facial recognition implementation using Keras VGG face

## Project Summary
* This project uses Open CV to locate a face in real time from video recording and the face will be classified as either Yining, Mohammad, or a stranger. This recognition is accomplished by fine-tuning a pre-trained deep neural network(VGG Face) in which the finals layers of the network are retrained to fit this objective.
* We used 600 pictures for training and 300 pictures for testing the fine-tuned model. Each picture is resized to 64*64 pixels.

## Built with:
 * Tensorflow
 * Keras
 * Open CV
 * [VGG Face](https://github.com/rcmalli/keras-vggface)
